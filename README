Multiple instances via ports

For this it needs to patch the init.d and start-memcached scripts to run multiple instances.

After the patch it search for configuration files that match the following pattern /etc/memcached_*.conf. When it found no file it use the /etc/memcached.conf configuration file. So it breaks no backward compatibility.

When you want to create 2 memached instances copy the configuration file and change the port, memory â€¦

cp /etc/memcached.conf /etc/memcached_myserver_1.conf
cp /etc/memcached.conf /etc/memcached_myserver_2.conf

Commands

start all servers

/etc/init.d/memcached start
start only a specific server

/etc/init.d/memcached start myserver_1
stop all servers

/etc/init.d/memcached stop
stop only a specific server
